// Download behavior used to be established in a bare goroutine, so a client
// whose first command started a download could be served first: the file
// landed in the browser's own download directory, outside the session's temp
// dir, where download.saveAs could not find it (#351).
//
// OnClientConnect runs before either transport starts reading client messages
// (server.handleWebSocket, cmd/clicker/pipe.go), which is why session.subscribe
// is synchronous there. This pins that setupDownloads now shares that
// guarantee.
//
// The proof is the held response, not timing: the fake browser reports when
// browser.setDownloadBehavior arrives and then answers nothing until the test
// says so. Only a synchronous setup can still be inside OnClientConnect at
// that point, so a backgrounded one fails here however the scheduler behaves.

// npx) all point at the shim's path, so changing the file behind that path is
// what switches every entry point at once. Same approach as esbuild.

// layout to link into), and only for a copy installed under node_modules.

// and npm executes a symlinked dependency's scripts in its real directory,
// which would overwrite the tracked shim in the working tree.
